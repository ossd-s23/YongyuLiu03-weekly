title: Week 1 - First Step to Open Source
---

Before hearing the term "open source", I have already had a weird practice of reading the source code of libraries and browser extensions, as well as clicking on the "view web page source code" tab in my browser. At that time, I took it for granted that their source codes were visible to us, simply admiring their intelligence and effort, not really thinking under the hood why programmers would public and put their hard work under the risk of plagiarism. It was when I was studying Linux OS that I officially learned about "open source". I felt honored, knowing that developers have the kindness to let us study, modify, and even redistribute open source projects. It was also interesting to know that Linux still makes money from tech companies that largely rely on it even if it's free - Google, whose Android and Chrome OS are both based on Linux, has heavily invested in Linux.  

"Open source" seems a real world utopia, but I had never thought of being a contributor. To be honest, I was completely focusing on the "software development" part as I enrolled in this course, hoping to enrich my experience and resume in this field, which professor Joanna classified as a common misconception among students. She introduced and really emphasized the term "community", which plays a dominant role in the open source world. I program alone in my major courses most of the time and somewhat hate communicating and socializing. Working within a community will definitely be a challenge for me, but I appreciate the strength of collaboration and look forward to working with people of the same mind.  

The advantages of open source mainly base on its free access to the source code and the community that maintains it.  grants users free access to the source code, 

Free access to the source code, allowing for customization and modification.
Collaboration and community development.
More secure as many developers can review and improve the code.
Lower cost of ownership, as it eliminates licensing fees.
Advantages of Closed Source:

Proprietary software often has better support and documentation.
Controlled release cycle.
May have better performance and user experience.
Potential Problems with Open Source:

Lack of commercial support and accountability.
Incomplete documentation.
Fragmented development, with multiple versions of a project.
Vulnerability to security threats if the community does not address them quickly.






open source (what do YOU think about when you hear the term "open source"? what are some advantages of open vs. closed source, what are some potential problems with open source, why did you decide to register for a class about open source software development?) 

projects: briefly talk about four open source projects that you regularly use or that influenced you in some way in the past (note, the projects do not have to be source code based) (Keep in mind that these blogs are publicly available to anybody who stumbles upon them. Make sure that the posts are appropriate.)
