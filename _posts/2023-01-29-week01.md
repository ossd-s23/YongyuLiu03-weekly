title: Week 1: First Step to Open Source
---

Before hearing the term "open source", I have already had a weird practice of reading the source code of libraries and browser extensions, as well as clicking on the "view web page source code" tab in my browser. At that time, I took it for granted that their source codes were visible to us, simply admiring their intelligence and effort, not really thinking under the hood why programmers would public and put their hard work under the risk of plagiarism. It was when I was studying Linux OS that I officially learned about "open source". I felt honored, knowing that developers have the kindness to let us study, modify, and even redistribute open source projects. It was also interesting to know that Linux still makes money from tech companies that largely rely on it even if it's free - Google, whose Android and Chrome OS are both based on Linux, has heavily invested in Linux.  
"Open source" seems a real world utopia, but I had never thought of being a contributor. To be honest, I was completely focusing on the "software development" part as I enrolled in this course, hoping to enrich my experience and resume in this field, which professor Joanna classified as a common misconception among students. She introduced and really emphasized the term "community", which plays a dominant role in the open source world. I program alone in my major courses most of the time and somewhat hate communicating and socializing. Working within a community will definitely be a challenge for me, but I appreciate the strength of collaboration and look forward to working with people of the same mind.
